# Study Bunny Notes
Only modified parts are included in this project. The original parts can be found on [here.](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder) 

## What to print

### Filament Blocks

Print all the parts in [this folder,](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder/Stls/Gear%20box) except for:
- "Filament_Block_xN.stl"
- "Filament_Blocks_End.stl"
- "[a]_Bearing_Insert_Feet_x2.stl"
- "[a]_Bearing_Insert_x2.stl"
- "[a]_Blocks_End_Feet.stl"

Instead, print these files (located in the STL folder of this project):
- **"FILAMENT_BLOCK_BEARING_V1A.stl"** QTY = floor((n+1)/3) = b. (For n = 9, QTY = 3)
- **"FILAMENT_BLOCK_V1A.stl"** QTY = n - b. (For n = 9, QTY = 6)
- **"FILAMENT_BLOCK_END_V1A.stl"**
- **"[a]FILAMENT_BLOCK_END_FOOT_V1A.stl"**

Where n is the number of ERCF filament tracks.

In addition, you should only need to print the "Top_Hat_Locker_1_xN.stl". Please contact me and let me know if this is not the case, and you have to use the higher pressure top hat lockers.

### Gear box

Print all the parts in [this folder,](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder/Stls/Gear%20box) except for "Gear_Box_Front.stl". 

Instead, print **"GEARBOX_FRONT_V1A.stl"** located in the STL folder of this project.

### Linear Axis
Unchanged, print all the parts in [this folder.](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder/Stls/Linear%20axis)

### Selector

Unchanged, print all the parts in [this folder.](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/Carrot_Feeder/Stls/Selector)

### Supports

This mod uses the same mounting interface as the standard ERCF, so existing ERCF mounting/support solutions will remain compatible.

### EASY BRD

A modified bracket for the EASY BRD has been included in the STL folder of this project, called "[a]ERCF_EASY_BRD_BRACKET_V1A.stl"

### Other

For ease of cable management, I recommend attaching some cable management clips to the 2020 extrusion. I use [this design](https://www.printables.com/model/6593-2020-extrusion-zip-tie-clip).
